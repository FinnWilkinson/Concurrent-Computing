# Concurrent Computing
Coursework code for the Concurrent computing unit I took in my 2nd year at the University of Bristol.

Coursework 1 asked us to create a version of the game of life, allocating sections of the image being
processed to different threads.

Coursework 2 asked us to create a simple Operating System that would execute programs, had time
management functionality, and also implement message passing. Ideas such as forking and dining philosophers
were explored and implemented where possible

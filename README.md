# Concurrent Computing
Coursework code for the Concurrent computing unit I took in my 2nd year at the University of Bristol.
Grade Achieved - 68

Coursework 1 asked us to create a version of the game of life, allocating sections of the image being
processed to different threads.

Coursework 2 asked us to create a simple Operating System that was able to schedule, manage, and execute simple programs using techniques such as message passing and priority scheduling. Crucial system instructions such as fork were also implemented to provide efficent functionality within the Operating System. This was programmed using a combination of C and assembly instructions.
